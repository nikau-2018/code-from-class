# Broken Kaleidoscope

This challenge is designed to get you started with initialising and updating **state** in your React components.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


## Pixels

Create a new **stateful** component (using the `class Foo extends...` syntax). Call it something meaningful to you: we suggest `Pixel`, since what you're after is a small colourful element rendering on the screen. It's going to start out bigger than one pixel though!
