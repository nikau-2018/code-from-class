# React Form Handling

Form handling in React.


## Install & run

After cloning this repo

```shell
yarn
yarn start
```


## Things to look at

URL                                | Form
-----------------------------------|-----
http://localhost:8080/             | Relatively complex form with validation and editing using controlled components. 
http://localhost:8080/simple       | Much simpler form, still using controlled components.


## Things to try

Add a bunch more text fields. Try adding more form elements that control appearance: for example, a checkbox that 'features' the item in the list by highlighting it, a slider for color opacity, or radio buttons for "will explode", "won't explode", "may explode (we're not sure)", etc. If you're feeling ambitious, add a file upload component!
